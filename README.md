# Errors/Bugs

    . Some known bugs is clicking generate recommendations twice, and graphing visualizations when adding more songs after 
    already having generated recommendations.

# Tests
    . There are a lot of tests included in this project. They test that the functionality works both using mocked and real data and also integrating different sections overall. Throughout the project, we created different tests that ensured that lots of different aspects of the project worked properly, and conceputalized four user story profiles that we wanted 
 * to account for in usability. This included 1. general recreational user, 2. music director of musical organization, 3. Gen X
 * user (simplistic usability and accessibility), 4. Spotify and developers (future integration ability and generalization). 
 * Overall, we thought of our target audience as B2C and B2B users, where the first three user stories are B2C and the last user
 * story is B2B. We used a variety of unit, integration, and random testing to test the key functionality of our project. 
 * We also checked our user interface and accessibility.



## How to Run Tests

### Front-End Tests:

    . To run the tests, make sure that you are CD into the frontend directory. You should have playwright installed
        but if you don't, in your terminal type:
                            npx playwright install
        once that is done, go back to your terminal and run the following commands to run the tests:
                            npx playwright test
                                - runs the tests
    . To run the jest tests, similarly make sure you are CD into frontend directory, on the unit.test.ts file
    	Then run the command: npm test [file name]

### Back-End Tests:

    . To run the tests in the backend, in the test suite we have a section on integration testing to backend API.
